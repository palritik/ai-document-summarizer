Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field of computer science
that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally
require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data, recognizing
patterns, understanding natural language, making decisions, and solving problems.

AI is widely used in many industries such as healthcare, finance, education,
transportation, and manufacturing. In healthcare, AI helps in disease diagnosis
and medical image analysis. In finance, AI is used for fraud detection, credit
scoring, and algorithmic trading.

AI continues to grow rapidly and is transforming the way businesses operate
and how people interact with technology across the world.
